access include financial limitations (such an insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the possiblity to 
take paid time off work to use such services), sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor
 health iteracy, low income).<br> Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).</h3><hr>
